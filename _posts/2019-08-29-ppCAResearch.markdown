## 2-party privacy preserving computing on Cardinality of sets

* A General method: garbled circuit

* Traditional publick-key asymmetric encryption scheme

* Using homomorphic encryption + polynomial representation #TODO:How is poly represent is possible?

* Approximate estimating on very large sets cardinality computing.#TODOï¼šhow is privacy computing feasible even it's inaccurate?


## Still no efficient ppCA solving on 2 party is found
