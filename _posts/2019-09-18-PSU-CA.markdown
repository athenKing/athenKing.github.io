##  The 1st paper experience (The total idea being proven to be infeasible)

cost of permutation-based protocol (interesting work, but not that related to the paper)

the general computing protocol: gmw, yao's garbled circuit (not that related to the paper)


the traditional public-key protocol [this should be proposed]

the security proof is the same as approximating private set union ...

experimental implementation [Optionally for now]

multiparty cases under this basic protocol

assume that the hash functions behave like independent random functions 


more formal problem description and property description 

unlinkability



some protocol extension: using jointness disjointness testing



some potential interface, how to measure hamming distance securely?
